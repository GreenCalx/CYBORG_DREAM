The Island :

The starting point, an island with two broken columns and a giant face floating inbetween. The player can talk to this
or wander around a little. He may, after some 'puzzle solving' and 'fighting' find a deceased body
with a Cortical Transponder on it. The player may equip it and move to the next chapter.


The Travel :

while visiting the first zone, the player should encounter a wood panel advertising
for a trip planning company. it has a button on it, that once pressed calls the company
if you are in possession of the Cortical Transponder.
Once the players calls the company, called Drifting Overseas,  a boat comes in and let the 
palyer go onto. The boat then continue his way picking up someone on another island ( there
are a lot of similar island with on people on it in the sea ). The dude coming in is called
Steve. They May discuss on the boat. Finally the boat should arrive at Chess-City.
